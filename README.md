## Why Diffusion Studio

Diffusion Studio is an open-source video editor that uses [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com) modules as the document source. Think IDE, but it renders a video canvas instead of text.

This goes both ways: edit on the canvas and the change lands in the code; edit the code and the canvas redraws.

The desktop app comes with a command line that lets agents watch and listen to your footage and cut it on a timeline.

## What it's for

- **Video editing**: raw footage into a finished cut
- **Motion graphics**: explainers, promos, and title sequences
- **Generative assets**: images, video, and voiceover, declared in code and composited into the timeline
- **Clipping**: highlights from a long video, reformatted for social
- **Video understanding**: summaries, scene search, quotes with timestamps

## Getting started

Use with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, or Gemini CLI. Install the skill once, globally:

```sh
npx skills add diffusionstudio/skills
```

`/editor` is the main skill you'll use. Ask for what you want in plain language. Behind it is `dapi`, the CLI that drives the app.

## Prompt examples

<details open>
<summary><b>Motion graphics</b></summary>

```text
/editor Create a ~20-second promo for vercel-labs/native in Vercel's presentation style. Research its official website, GitHub, and brand guidelines; use authentic assets and verified product features, with crisp typography, polished motion, and a strong final CTA.
```

```text
/editor Recreate the 3blue1brown animation from https://youtu.be/HEfHFsfGXjs, closely matching its visual style, pacing, framing, colors, labels, and transitions. Use the exact collision mathematics from Gregory Galperin's original paper, do not approximate the physics.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Video editing</b></summary>

```text
/editor edit the footage in /path/to/folder
```

```text
/editor turn this footage into a polished YouTube video. Add readable captions and an attention-grabbing graphic in the opening to give viewers a strong visual hook.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Clipping</b></summary>

```text
/editor Can you pull the best 30-second moment from https://youtu.be/MtQ0qxyf-Ds and make a vertical version for social?

## Made with Diffusion Studio

Both were created by prompting. The compositions are published in [diffusionstudio/open-projects](https://github.com/diffusionstudio/open-projects):

| [Launch video](https://github.com/diffusionstudio/open-projects/tree/main/launch-video) | [Raise announcement](https://github.com/diffusionstudio/open-projects/tree/main/raise-announcement) |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="assets/launch-video.gif" alt="Launch video" width="420" /> | <img src="assets/raise-announcement.gif" alt="Raise announcement" width="420" /> |

## Compositions as code

A project is a folder of that JSX: `dapi open <dir>` once, then edit the files. Saving recompiles the entry file and mounts it directly into the editor's ECS.

Every element carries an `id`, which is how the write-back finds its target: a rect dragged on the canvas, a clip trimmed on the timeline, or a retyped line lands as a prop on the element that authored it.

The root is a `<stage>` holding one `<scene>` per frame you cut in:

```tsx
import { For } from "solid-js";
import { generate } from "@diffusionstudio/jsx";

const hero = generate.image({ prompt: "A neon city at night, cinematic", aspectRatio: "16:9" });
const motion = generate.video({ prompt: "slow camera push-in", startFrame: hero, duration: 5 });

const TITLES = [
  { text: "The Grid", start: 0, end: 2.5 },
  { text: "Neon Nights", start: 2.5, end: 5 },
];

export default function Project() {
  return (
    <stage camera={[0.3, 0, 0, 0.3, 85, 150]}>
      <scene name="Intro" width={1920} height={1080} fill="black" active>
        <video src={motion} start={0} end={5} width={1920} height={1080} />
        <For each={TITLES}>
          {(t) => (
            <text
              width={1920}
              height={1080}
              textAlign="center"
              textBaseline="middle"
              fontSize={128}
              color="#FFFFFF"
              start={t.start}
              end={t.end}
            >
              {t.text}
            </text>
          )}
        </For>
      </scene>
    </stage>
  );
}
```

Everything a mount produces stays a first-class editor node, so a person can pick up in the UI exactly where the script left off.

## Seeing and hearing the media

Cutting footage requires understanding it. The CLI ships the inspection tools an agent needs to work with media it cannot watch:

```sh
dapi media probe clip.mp4                                # container + codec metadata, like ffprobe
dapi media grab clip.mp4 -t 0 12 45                      # decode frames to PNGs
dapi media filmstrip clip.mp4                            # grid of video frames
dapi media waveform track.mp3                            # audio waveform, silence flagged
dapi media transcribe interview.wav                      # timed, word-level transcript
dapi media listen interview.mp4 -p "what is said in the intro?"   # ask a multimodal model
dapi capture intro -t 0 2 4                              # the frames a render would produce, by scene id
```

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dapi open` | Launch the app and open (or create) a project folder, anywhere on disk |
| `dapi context` | Summary of app state |
| `dapi capture` | Render frames of a scene, as an export would, to a labelled contact sheet or one PNG per position |
| `dapi render` / `dapi export` | Render a scene to MP4, WebM, Ogg, or MOV through the desktop encoder |
| `dapi check` | Check a node's subtree for structural mistakes (black-frame gaps, never-visible nodes, failed sources) and report subtree stats |
| `dapi media …` | Inspect a file by id or path: `probe`, `grab`, `filmstrip`, `waveform`, `transcribe`, `listen` |
| `dapi models` / `dapi voices` / `dapi fonts` | Discover generation models, speech voices, local fonts |
| `dapi screenshot` / `dapi logs` | The app itself: capture the window, read recent console output |
| `dapi fetch` | Download a video from yt/tt/ig |
| `dapi whoami` | The authenticated account |
| `dapi report` | Report a bug in the CLI or the app: diagnostics bundled, filed as a GitHub issue via `gh` |

Conventions throughout: single results are one JSON value, collections are JSON Lines, errors go to stderr with exit code `1`. Everything is built to be piped, grepped, and driven by a program.

## Windows

### Requirements

- Windows 11, 64-bit
- Node.js 20 or newer and npm for source development
- A current graphics driver with the WebGPU and WebCodecs features exposed by Chromium; available hardware codecs depend on the GPU and driver

The installed app and packaged `dapi` launcher do not require a separate Node.js installation.

### Develop from source

Run the complete development stack from PowerShell or Windows Terminal:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/kaushika05/editor.git
cd editor
npm ci
Copy-Item apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` builds the CLI, starts Vite, waits for it, builds the desktop
main/preload processes, and launches Electron. Ctrl+C stops the complete
process tree. Git Bash and WSL are not required.

To expose the source-build CLI on the user PATH, run:

```powershell
npm run link:create --workspace=@diffusionstudio/cli
```

Open a new terminal after creating or removing the link. Undo it with
`npm run link:remove --workspace=@diffusionstudio/cli`.

### Build and install

```powershell
npm run make:windows
```

The unsigned development installer is written below
`apps\desktop\out\make\squirrel.windows\x64`. Run the generated
`Diffusion-Studio-x64-Setup.exe` to install it for the current user.

In the packaged application, choose **File > Install dapi Command Line Tool…**,
then open a new terminal. The app installs a launcher and its runtime below
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Diffusion Studio\bin` and adds only that directory to the user
PATH. It can be reversed with **File > Uninstall dapi Command Line Tool…**.

```powershell
dapi --help
dapi open C:\path\to\project
dapi context
dapi capture intro -t 0 2
dapi render intro -o C:\path\to\intro.mp4
```

### Windows release configuration and known limitations

- CI installers are intentionally unsigned. Production distribution needs a Windows code-signing certificate; unsigned installers can trigger a SmartScreen warning.
- Auto-update uses Squirrel.Windows through `update-electron-app`. A production update requires published Squirrel release artifacts and signing; development runs never initialize the updater.
- The web app exposes a Windows download only when `VITE_WINDOWS_DOWNLOAD_URL` points at an installer that deployment has actually published. This fork's Windows workflow uploads its package as a GitHub Actions artifact instead of creating a public branded release.

## Contributing / local setup

Requirements: Node 20+ and npm. The same top-level command works on macOS and Windows.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/diffusionstudio/editor.git
cd editor
npm install

cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env   # required: the app won't run without it

npm run dev
```

To put a source-build `dapi` on your PATH, use the cross-platform linker:

```sh
npm run link:create --workspace=@diffusionstudio/cli
```

The link points at the CLI build, which `npm run dev:desktop` refreshes on every start, so the linked `dapi` always runs the latest code.

Before sending a PR:

```sh
npm run check    # typecheck all workspaces
npm run lint     # lint all workspaces
```
