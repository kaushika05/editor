# `dapi context`

Summary of app state: what the project's source cannot say. The composition
itself — its scenes, what is selected, which scene is active, the work area —
is all in the JSX, and a caller that wants any of it reads the file. Alias:
`ctx`.

## Input

None.

## Output

One JSON object:

```ts
{
  rootDir:      string | null;   // absolute folder projects live under; null until one is picked
  projectDir:   string | null;   // absolute open project folder — where the JSX being edited lives; null when none is open
  projectReady: boolean;         // true after the open project's compiled scene has mounted
  currentTime:  number | null;   // playhead in the active scene, in seconds; null if no scene is active
  fontFamilies: string[];        // families registered in the running world, valid as `fontFamily`
  generations:  {                // every generated source in the project, and where it stands
    element: string | null;      // the element's source stamp, `<file>:<id>`; null for an entity no element produced
    name:    string | null;      // the element's `name`, when it has one
    state:   "generating" | "failed" | "done";
    error?:  string;             // what it failed with, on `failed` rows
    asset?:  string;             // the library path it landed as, on `done` rows
  }[];
}
```

With no project open (the app sits at the dashboard) the report is just
`{ rootDir, projectDir: null, projectReady: false }`: there is no playhead, no
world, and no fonts to speak of. Open one with [`dapi open`](./open.md).

`rootDir` is reported whether or not a project is open — it is where a caller
with nothing open goes to create or find one.

`currentTime` is local to the active scene, the same origin a clip's `start`
and `end` are placed against, and in the same unit.

`projectDir` is the folder the app is editing, which is not necessarily the
one a command was run from: check it before writing to source files.

`projectReady` distinguishes a route that has mounted from a project whose
compiled scene is available. `dapi open` waits for this automatically, so the
next capture, check, render, or screenshot command can run immediately.

`fontFamilies` is what text can be drawn with right now — loaded into the world,
not merely named in the source — and always includes the editor default. For
every family installed on the machine, see [`dapi fonts`](./fonts.md).

`generations` is how a caller waits for `generate.*` declarations without
blocking: generation is asynchronous, so poll this until nothing is
`generating`. A `done` row's `asset` is a library path, ready for
[`dapi media probe`](./media/probe.md) and its siblings; a `failed` row's
`error` is the same message the element carries as its `error` prop, which is
what keeps it from being generated again (see
[jsx/errors.md](./jsx/errors.md#failed-sources)).
